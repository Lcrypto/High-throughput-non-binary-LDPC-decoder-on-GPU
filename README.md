# High-Throughput Multi-Codeword Non-Binary LDPC (NB-LDPC) Decoder on GPU
This is the source codes of our proposed NB_LDPC decoder on GPU. The article about it has been accepted in the IEEE Communications Letters.

It is better to rebuild the project according to your GPU architecture and CUDA version. Before running the rebuilt NB-LDPC decoder, the parameters LOG_GF, BLOCK_FRAME, ACTIVE_BLOCK defined in "TotalDefine.h" should be set according to the code you select.
